# Class Assignment Work: Grid Layout

## Assignment Description
This is a class assignment where we were asked to create a **grid layout** using **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**. The layout replicates a structure with sections like Navbar, Header, Article, Ads, and Footer.

## What We Created
We built a responsive grid-based webpage with the following layout:

- **Navbar**: It takes the left side of the screen and fills the entire height of the layout.
- **Header**: It is placed at the top and takes two columns horizontally.
- **Article**: It is the center section for the main content.
- **Ads**: It is placed to the right of the Article.
- **Footer**: It is placed at the bottom and takes two columns horizontally.

### Features:
- **Tailwind CSS** is used for fully responsive design.
- **CSS Grid** is used for precise layout control.
- The entire layout horizontally centered with the use of Flexbox.

### Technologies Used:
- Next.js for the framework and routing.
- React.js for the component-based structure.
- Tailwind CSS for styling and responsive design.

This project uses modern web development techniques in building structured and aesthetically pleasing layouts with less effort.
